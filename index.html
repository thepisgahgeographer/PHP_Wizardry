            <h2>Heritage At A Glance</h2>
            <p>
                The center is being utilized for a chronological history of Caldwell County, from pre-Colonial days until the present, through a series of exhibits. Among the historic treasures are Native American spears and arrow points, early maps, grants, and deeds. There is also information and pictures about the founding of Caldwell County, as well as the establishment of the town of Lenoir as the county seat and its development into a railroad terminus and furniture manufacturing center. The museum also has several special interest collections: medical, music, military, and photography. Special collections of loaned items are featured for short periods of time each year.
